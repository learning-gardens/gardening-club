# Gardening Club

We are the #gardening channel in the Learning Gardens Slack, a slow-burning space for sharing &amp; increasing knowledge &amp; appreciation of plants. This GitHub project exists to record the best gardening resources our discussion turns up (see below). Anyone is free to add to this document. You can also suggest that something is added here by reacting with the :evergreen_tree: (evergreen) emoji on a Slack message and I'll try to make a record here.
